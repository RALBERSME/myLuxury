        Our wonderful ship is called the
        <strong>«SS Île de France»</strong> and was launched in 1926. The French
        shipping company Compagnie Générale Transatlantique signed a contract
        with the French government in 1916 to build four passenger ships. The
        first of these ships was the <em> «SS Paris»</em>, which was put into
        service in 1921. The «SS Île de France» was launched on March 14, 1926,
        and began its first sea trials on May 29, 1926. At that time, the large
        ocean liners were competing for the Blue Riband, the award for the ship
        that could cross the Atlantic the fastest. The «SS Île de France», with
        a length of 214.35 meters and a width of 28 meters, was never the
        fastest ship with a top speed of 23.5 knots per hour (that's about 44
        kilometers per hour)...but it was one of the ships with a charming
        interior. Everything was in the Art Deco style. <br /><br />

        The «SS Île de France» was the world's largest new passenger ship built
        after the First World War.

        The salon furnishings from 1926 show the lavishly gold-decorated first
        class salon. But the other rooms also stood out from previous ocean
        liners. All cabins now had beds instead of bunks. A magnificent
        staircase led to the exquisite dining room. There was even a carousel
        for children on board.
        <br />
        The «SS Île de France» made its maiden voyage on June 22, 1927. It was
        received with great applause in New York. Due to its splendor, wealthy
        Americans and Europeans preferred this ship for their transatlantic
        crossings, bringing in a lot of money for the French shipping company.
        The luxury was increased even further when a seaplane catapult was
        installed on the ship in 1928, from which flying boats could launch that
        flew ahead of the ship with the mail when the «SS Île de France» was
        about 200 nautical miles from land. This meant that the mail could be
        distributed on the mainland one day before the ship arrived. This also
        meant that at least its postal service was the fastest between Europe
        and the USA (until 1930, when this achievement was discontinued for cost
        reasons).
        <br /><br />
        On September 1, 1939, the Second World War began, as a result of which
        civil transatlantic traffic was suspended by France.
