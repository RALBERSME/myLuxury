          It was only a few hours ago that the «SS Île de France» left the port
          of New York with 940 passengers on board, bound for Europe. As is
          usual, a tugboat helped her leave the pier. Almost at the same time,
          the Stockholm left the port of New York. The Stockholm was a Swedish
          liner taking 534 passengers home to Gothenburg. It followed the «SS
          Île de France» through the Hudson River, but the «SS Île de France»
          was much faster, and the «SS Île de France» soon left it behind. Then
          heavy fog came up and it was now so thick that you couldn't see
          anything in front of your eyes. The «SS Île de France» therefore
          closed the watertight doors, positioned additional lookout posts, only
          drove on standby and constantly checked the radar.
          <br /><br />
          The «SS Île de France»`s radar showed two signals, which were getting
          closer and closer to each other at a distance of 40 nautical miles
          behind the «SS Île de France» and then merging into one another.
          <br /><br />
          The chief radio operator of the «SS Île de France» ran to the bridge
          and informed the captain that he had received SOS signals from the
          Andrea Doria. Everyone was confused. The Andrea Doria was an Italian
          luxury liner. Could it be that she was in distress?
          <br /><br />
          Captain de Beaudéan had to react. He had a duty to arrive in France
          without delay. Should he turn back? If the emergency call wasn't
          justified, he would have to travel back to New York to refuel, many
          passengers and goods would be delayed, that would be the shipping
          company's responsibility cost a lot of money. But what if the
          emergency call was real and people's lives were in danger? He ordered
          the ship to turn around and approach the suspected accident site at
          maximum speed. The number of lookout posts was doubled again. The «SS
          Île de France» came to a stop about 400 meters from the Andrea Doria,
          which was unable to maneuver.
          <br />The fog revealed a gruesome sight. The Stockholm and the Andrea
          Doria had collided, and the reinforced bow of the Stockholm, which was
          designed for ice water, had cut open the starboard side of the Andrea
          Doria. The water had immediately entered and caused the Andrea Doria
          to list heavily.<br />

          The bow of the Stockholm was destroyed, but this liner managed to stay
          afloat for a few hours while the Andrea Doria slowly sank. Due to the
          heavy list, half of the lifeboats were not operational. It was a
          matter of life and death for 1,706 people.
          <br /><br />
          Other ships had also heard the distress signal and turned to, but they
          were small and poorly equipped. The Stockholm hesitated to take on all
          of the Andrea Doria's passengers due to its massive damage.
          <br /><br />
          Captain de Beaudéan had the «SS Île de France» maneuvered so that the
          damaged ships were as protected from the waves as possible. All lights
          were switched on on board the «SS Île de France» to show the people in
          distress that help was at hand. With the help of the small ships and
          the lifeboats, all but 46 passengers and crew members were eventually
          rescued.
          <br /><br />
          The «SS Île de France» returned to New York immediately so that the
          injured survivors could receive professional care as quickly as
          possible. The crew was celebrated as heroes in New York Harbor.
