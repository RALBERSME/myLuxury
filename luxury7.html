        At the end of the 1960s, passenger transport increasingly shifted to
        airplanes. The passenger numbers of ocean liners fell massively and it
        was therefore decided that the «SS Île de France» should be sold.
        <br /><br />
        On February 26, 1959, she set off on her last voyage and became a movie
        star. This was because the filmmaker Andrew Stone wanted to make a
        disaster film about an aging luxury liner. To make everything realistic,
        he used the «SS Île de France», which is renamed the «SS Claritin» in
        the film. Despite real explosions on board, the critics tore up the
        film, which resulted in a loss of $551,000 for MGM. The remains of the
        ship were then scrapped in Japan.<br /><br />

        The «SS Île de France» rescued 735 people from the Andrea Doria and 24
        crew members from the freighter Greenville. It brought around 300,000
        soldiers to Europe and Africa in preparation for D-Day and transported
        around 1.5 million passengers across the Atlantic during its service
        (1927 - 1959). There's a standing ovation and a winning song for
        that!<br /><br />
