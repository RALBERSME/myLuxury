        At the end of the 1960s, passenger transport increasingly shifted to
        airplanes. The passenger numbers of ocean liners fell massively and it
        was therefore decided that the Ile de France should be sold.
        <br /><br />
        On February 26, 1959, she set off on her last voyage and became a movie
        star. This was because the filmmaker Andrew Stone wanted to make a
        disaster film about an aging luxury liner. To make everything realistic,
        he used the Ile de France, which is renamed the S.S. Claritin in the
        film. Despite real explosions on board, the critics tore up the film,
        which resulted in a loss of $551,000 for MGM. The remains of the ship
        were then scrapped in Japan.<br /><br />
