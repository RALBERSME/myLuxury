            It was only after Germany's capitulation that the Ile of France
            returned to French hands. Years of repair work followed. After World
            War II, France no longer had any shiny ocean liners. The S.S. Paris
            burned down and sank on April 19, 1939, and the S.S. Normandy fell
            victim to the flames in 1942. As war reparations, France received
            the German luxury liner "Europa", which was the sister ship of the
            legendary "Bremen". <br /><br />
            That is why the French put so much effort into converting the S.S.
            Ile de France back into a stately liner. The three chimneys were
            removed and two larger, more modern chimneys were put in their
            place. The ship was repainted and given a modern interior. In 1949
            it resumed its transatlantic services and once again impressed as an
            elegant luxury ship.
