          By the outbreak of World War II, the «SS Île de France» had completed
          more than 346 transatlantic crossings and transported more than
          245,000 people. This made it one of the most successful ships of the
          1930s.
          <br /><br />
          On September 3, 1939, it set sail for New York for the last time, this
          time fully loaded with 1,777 passengers, far more than the ship's
          regular passenger capacity of 1,644. The passengers were mostly
          Americans fleeing war. Only two days earlier, Germany had illegally
          immigrated to Poland. Three hours after the Ile de France left the
          French port, France, like England, declared war on the Germans.
          <br /><br />
          The nerves of the passengers and the crew were on edge. They could now
          be attacked by German submarines at any time.
          <br /><br />
          On September 9, 1939, the ship finally arrived in New York Harbor. The
          shipping company stopped the ship's service. But the ship could not
          remain in the harbor permanently. So after five months it was towed to
          Staten Island. The crew was reduced from 800 men to just 100 men in
          order to reduce costs and ensure the ship's maintenance.
          <br />
          In March 1940, the ship was placed under the command of the British
          Admiralty. It was given a black-gray military paint job and loaded
          with 12,000 tons of war materials, tanks, oil for submarines and
          dismantled bombers. The ship set sail for Europe in May 1940.
          <br />
          In early 1941, the ship was hastily converted into a troop transport.
          Together with the ocean liners Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, Mauritania
          and New Amsterdam, as well as other ships, a huge convoy was formed in
          March 1941, which transported Australian troops to North Africa with
          more than 4,000 soldiers. Due to the rush, ventilation, food and
          sanitary facilities were not taken into account and the crossings
          became torture for the Australian soldiers.
          <br /><br />

          In 1944, the «SS Île de France» was handed over to the Cunard White
          Star Line shipping company, which was preparing to transport American
          and Canadian troops to Europe.
          <br />
          The ship was thus rebuilt once again, but even though the conditions
          for the soldiers improved, it was still very cramped and
          uncomfortable. However, it played an important role in helping to
          prepare for the so-called D-Day. It had transported an estimated
          485,000 soldiers and the once luxury ship now looked battered and
          worn.
